# IRIS-Dataset-Classification-using Scikit Learn.
The iris flowers have different species and one can distinguish them based on the length of petals and sepals.
Used Scikit-learn to predict the species of a new iris flower using IRIS flower dataset.

# code written is the practice code referenced from: sklearn.org
so the IRIS dataset auto loaded has linked github: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/b3ea3ed6a09fe774dfc5160a65172b1bacbb2a82/sklearn/datasets/data
